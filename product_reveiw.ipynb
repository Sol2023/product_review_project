      "Comment: My pup is one of those dogs who has the nasty habit of eating poop. If I don't monitor her then she will eat her own and  her sister's feces as well. Plus, both of my pups love to eat the cat and possum poop that gets burried under the mulch along the sidewalks late at night while the rest of the neighborhood sleeps soundly and unsuspectingly. My pups will yank me off course the second they smell the pungent poop de possum, burrying their noses in the dirt and slurping it up before I am able to react. DISGUSTING!!!!Lucky for me, awhile ago a friend accidentally had one of her orders from Chewy shipped to me. We got everything straightened out and sent her a new box, but I got to keep the box sent to me and I shared some of the goodies with a local rescue too. Anyways, among the goodies she had ordered were these Twistix Yogurt Chew Treats. She had ordered both the banana and mint flavors. I gave one to each of my sweet puppies, at a time when they were behaving, and I noticed how wonderful it made their breath smell. Surprisingly enough, my doggy doo doo eater normally has pretty good breath, however my other pup has pretty disgusting breath from licking her anal glands. Poop pup.Well, the next time Poopy Puppy managed to snag herself a disgusting snack I decided she needed to floss her teeth with a Twistix Yogurt and Banana Dental Chew treat. Boy am I glad I gave her one! It did the trick of cleaning out the nasty particles that I could see clinging to her back teeth when she had flashed me a big, toothy grin and I easily caught a waft of her sewage breath. But after the Twistix I wasn't as paranoid about her stealing one of my pillows off of the couch or doing something equally appalling.I know I chose to live with this disgusting monster, and I definitely love her. But I'm truly thankful to have discovered something that helps make the difficult parts much more bearable. Because it's no fun to think the best thing in your life is unbearable in the slightest.\n",

She has a severe underbite and her bottom teeth stick out no matter what, but our vet is always shocked those teeth are in perfect condition. As a puppy they told us we might have to remove those teeth in a year or two because they’re constantly out and would rot, but we’re almost to 9 years & the vet said to keep doing what we’re doing because those teeth are in great condition!\n",

      "Comment: My Yorkie loves these treats. I was worried about these treats when I first took them out of the bag because they're hard like chalk and my dog is 13 years old. She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain. I just have to clean her up every time after she's had one of these treats.\n",

As their fur-mommy, I love these bc they’re Made in the USA, with high-quality ingredients!

It's not just the ingredients that make this calming. Gnawing on one of these lets her get some of her nervous energy out in a safe way, and I think it's been very effective. She struggles with separation anxiety and falls apart when I leave, but if I give her one of these first and then sneak out the door she does a lot better. I'd definitely recommend these for any anxious dogs out there!\n",

      "Comment: My dogs loved these just as much as the popular brand of dog dental treats. They are much more firm by my feel, but they chewed them up fine. I have an Australian shepherd and a beagle. I was worried about the beagle swallowing it whole, but she chewed it well.I did not notice a difference in their energy levels- my Aussie is very energetic and my 13 year old Beagle has high anxiety. Maybe with more use I would notice a change.I'm not a fan of the smell, but it's not terrible. Just weird. Like perfumed beef jerky.\n",

      "Comment: These are great chews. The ingredients are natural and healthy, and my dogs really love them.Potatoes are the first ingredient, and there are a number of calming ingredients like chamomile, hops, passion flower, lemon balm, and lavender.They really do seem to calm my dogs down after around 20 minutes of chewing.  But I wish they told you the amount of active ingredients; you have no way of knowing the dosage of herbs in a product like this without that information.Still, the quality is very good and my dogs like them so I'm satisfied.Overall - good quality calming chews for dogs, but probably not the most effective calming treats out there.\n",

We bring their blankets white noise machines, all of their toys and their special treats that they only get on special occasions or traveling when we laughed and gave one of these to the dogs we let her start eating it before we left the house completely and she still had her eyes on us she looked like she was just really into the flavor. We laughed and went outside to peek through the window, just to see how it was since we finally left, she just seemed to calmly enjoy her treat , when we got home, she and the cat were both napping together it didn’t look like the cat had jumped around and disturbed too much or that the dog had really done anything either. It was very nice to come in to that pleasant relaxing site of them instead of seeing signs of distress and them scratching and whining at the door as soon as they heard us coming in\n",

      "Comment: My dogs really like these dark colored chew sticks and will keep them busy for about 5 minutes.  These are supposedly chicken flavor and upon opening the bag, you get the scent of chicken bouillon and original Pringles potato chips.  I would surmise that they are definitely flavored like chicken and that my dogs seem to really like them.  The dark color of the sick does not seem to stain light carpet, but if you have a dog that likes to lick and moisten the treat before eating it then that may be a different story, however neither their teeth nor tongue were stained after eating these treats.  I can't say how well they clean teeth or freshen breath, but since the sticks are pleasantly scented, they don't seem to contribute to foul smelling breath.  These sticks are about the right size for small and medium sized dogs, however any size dog would probably like these treats.  If you are looking for a chew treat for your dog that actually has chicken scent, these are it.\n"

Neither dog was super active nor had the zoomies before hand, but now both are laying on the couch relaxing, one is even snoring. I'd say they are relaxed.I'm not sure this would calm a dog that is already hyped up, but in the same way a cup of tea won't help an angry human, but it can make nighttime even more relaxing, I look forward to helping the boys wind down for the night with a calming treat.\n",

My puppy would chew on this for a few minutes or at night but this could not keep his attention for very long. Maybe he didn't care for the flavor as much as he liked my shoes but who knows. This is why I am giving it a 4/5 because other bones and such I have purchased have kept his attention for hours. My puppy did use this just not for very long. It's a product you need to try for your puppy if you think it will help with their teething. Not expensive at all, in fact seen this at my local pet store for $5 more.\n",

We have been giving him 500mg lysine twice a day as the vet directed and keeping him on antibiotics to prevent a bacterial side infection in his lungs, but he has not been getting any better.  Within two days of giving him these he has less rattling in his lungs, this has been the only improvement in his condition we have seen in over a month.  I did the math and for 6 chews there is only about 70mg of lysine, and since we have been giving him high doses of lysine for over a month the lysine is obviously not the ingredient in these chews that is helping.  I am therefore left to assume it is the probiotic.  While he is still far from recovered this has given me hope and I am going to look into a more broad spectrum probiotic and see if we can get him over this flare and onto a preventive regime which I think these chews will make be a part of.\n",

      "Comment: Every cat is an individual, and they know what they like and what they don't. Although many cats seem to love these Biteables, my senior cat would have nothing to do with it. I tried a single treat whole, then broken in half, and he just sniffed it and walked away each time. The next morning I even broke one in half and hid it in the middle of his wet cat food, which he normally inhales the minute I put it in his bowl. He ate around the treat halves and left them in his otherwise empty bowl. He loves chicken, which is the primary ingredient in these treats, but apparently that wasn't enough to entice him. In people years my cat is 88 years old, so it's not like he's going to change his food preferences at this stage of his life. The \"chicken and tuna recipe\" on the package is a bit misleading, since the tuna is only \"natural tuna flavor\" and not the real deal, and the same with the \"natural fish flavor.\" I am still rating this product 3 stars even though my cat didn't like it because I think the L-lysine, taurine, and probiotics probably would have been good for him if he had been willing to eat these treats.\n",

Unfortunately only 1 of our 3 cats would remotely touch them and it was only once.  I’m sure it’s just that our cats are picky about their food and treats.  They seems to be good quality with good packaging. Our cats just prefer the junky treats to the healthy ones. Go figure.\n"

      "Comment: Different cats have different tastes so normally I wouldn't give a product two stars just because my cats didn't like the flavor but I really think it's warranted and possibly even generous in the case of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables because both of my cats really love treats but they absolutely hate these.The package boasts that Get Naked Biteables provide essential health benefits including lysine and probiotics and that the #1 ingredient is real chicken--although that last one doesn't actually mean anything because they could be saying that the highest quality or most expensive ingredient is chicken, not necessarily that chicken makes up the largest actual portion.  In any case, these are not cat food--they are cat treats.  With cat food, strong health benefits are definitely something you want to look for but with treats the number one most important thing is flavor.  Cats should be thrilled when you pull out the package and they see that you are about to give them a treat.I have two cats.  They both love treats.  They both ate exactly one of these Get Naked Bitables treats and will not touch them again.  They absolutely hate the flavor which means these aren't much of a treat as far as my cats are concerned.  Get Naked Biteables might well be very nutritious but they neglected the single most important thing that every cat treat needs which is great taste.\n",

      "Comment: Our Siamese kitten is kind of picky about her food yet she loved these soft heart shaped chewable cat treats. They are made in the USA, and chicken is the first ingredient, however they smell more fishlike.  These treats are more than a treat, they are a probiotic containing Lysine which is an essential amino acid helps pets produce antibodies and enzymes that support immune systems.  It is also helpful for calcium absorption which supports strong bones and promotes healthy skin. This is important, so our kitties can fight diseases and have healthy bones. Cats do not make lysine on their own. They must obtain it through their food and supplements.  L-lysine is not for all cats so check with your vet. I do not agree on the dosage. I think these treats should be used sparingly because it can interfere with other medications. The package is small but affordable. I’m feeding our 7 month old cat one a day to support a healthy gut and immune system.\n",

      "Comment: My cats really like these.  As in gobbled them down before the dog realized they were getting treats.  I may have to replace the other lysine treats with these.  However, a serving size is something like 4 or 5 a day.  With the number of cats I have, they will go fast. The other lysine treats I use are one to two a day.  And they aren't as popular.  Though fortunately, the one cat that really needs them also likes them.  And price-wise, they are about the same.However, they do make a joint health treat that I may have to try for my cat with a damaged spine (before I owned him - got him that way from the vet where he was dropped off)  I've yet to find a treat/pill that he will take.\n",

      "Comment: My older gray tabby has had feline herpesvirus since she was a young adult. Lysine can be a good thing to try to help these cats with their symptoms of sneezing and rasping. She loves these Biteables and seems to think they are a treat on par with Temptations, and that is in contrast to other lysine supplements she has quickly lost interest in.Cats with breathing difficulties sometimes also have trouble with their sense of smell, and I suspect the ingredients here such as natural fish and tuna flavors are strong enough (but pleasant to the human nose) to maintain their appeal to a congested kitty. The main ingredients here are chicken, glycerin, sweet potatoes, tapioca starch and L-lysine.These snacks also contains dried Bacillus fermentation product, designed to promulgate digestive health.The manufacturer recommends five to six of these soft treats per day. The treats are made in the US and specifics are not provided (that I can see) on where the ingredients are sourced.Review of Get Naked Essential Health Biteables, Land & Sea Recipe, 3 oz,Natural,912672\n",

They're a source of good nutrition too! They weren't universally accepted in my household as 3 out of 4 of my cats gobbled the treats down while one refused them. So this may not be for every cat.

      "Comment: My kitty LOVES these treats – like climbing on me to get them!  So, no problem there at all.  My kitty is a big long kitty weighing in at 16 pounds, though.  The directions say to give 5 to 6 treats for cats over 5 pounds.  I am not a scientist but maybe my kitty would rather need like 10 to 15 treats for her weight?  I dunno – I know sometimes it doesn’t work that way.  Either way – 5 to 6 treats every day seems like a lot for my baby.  I don’t give her many treats – and definitely not even every day.  So, for me – these work more of a treat with benefits rather than a supplement.  But to each their own.  Taste wise – my baby LOVES these – and that is what is most important!If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )\n",

This takes her a few hours but more importantly it keeps her attention and satisfies her chewing urge.My frenchie is about 15 pounds at six months old and has most of her adult teeth, they’re still growing in and she needs to sink them into something.Tbh I hesitated about getting such a big bone for my small dog, but it was the right call. Not only does it keep her busy for a while but because it’s so big, it’s stripped her of the urge she started getting with the small bones to swallow them whole as soon as they seems small enough. Now she chews it down to a tiny nub and doesn’t try to swallow it (tho I still grab it and throw it away if I see it).Good bone, do recommend for smaller dog if they are a strong chewer.\n",

She's made her way thru one end of it & it's her first choice in her basket full of toys.She's currently teething & I'm surprised at how long the bone has lasted. I'm getting ready to purchase another one now to have on hand!!\n",

She loved the teething rings by this brand but after she figured out how to get through the first one, she was able to chew through them in about 5 minutes. These bones have lasted her hours! The first one she finished in about 4/5 hours so that’s an improvement from the rings. Just ordered the 7in one pack to see how long that one will last her.\n",

That time includes the minute he spends licking every surface the bone might have touched.With how happy the bones make him, I wished the bones lasted longer, but paying about $1 a minute isn’t in my budget.Also, the bones made him a bit gassy.

      "Comment: So, I've been getting these for my dog a while now. She normally scarfs them down over the course of an hour, but the latest time, she decided she wanted to keep one end of it to put in her little treat stash. About a week later, she grabbed it, we played fetch with it (it was hard like rock now) and she ate it; I thought nothing of it because it still chewed apart. Later that day, about 12 hours, she threw up a large amount pieces that weren't digesting. Even though they weren't splintering, the pieces were just sitting in her stomach like a bunch of rocks. They were getting smoother and I'm sure still digesting, but they were also causing obvious pain to her and she was unable to eat anything else while they were still clanking around in her stomach.I'd still absolutely recommend these to dog owners, but with much more caution and awareness. Once the texture isn't the soft-ish bendable feel it was out of the bag, its time to toss it. I got lucky she threw them up, and that none of the harder bits did splinter, but its important to be aware of things like intestinal blockages or damage that can occur from treats that appear fine.\n"

Better to have to many that's none at all!!The best part is how long they last!!! She carries them with her wherever she goes; around the house, to the car, to visit relatives. Great product and I hope they add the chicken flavored ones on here for subscription too!\n"

She isn't a great huge hulking dog either...she is a corgi mix and can still put these bones away sometimes faster than real bones. Real bones are kinda rough on her innards, but these bones seem to break down in her digestion system much better. So they are a winner with me.\n"

However this time they did agree and the verdict is that they were unimpressed by the flavor of this bone.The size is great. The texture holds up pretty nicely to aggressive chewing. While it doesn’t stain fabric, it does leave a faint residue when wet from slobber. There’s absolutely no smell which is wonderful. The only downside is that my dogs weren’t impressed with the flavor. With that said, I’m hopeful that there are less finicky pups out there who might actually enjoy the product!\n",

My Lhasa barely touched his and one of the prongs came off and we couldn’t get it out of his mouth when he started to choke on the knub he had reduced the broken prong to. Thankfully my teen son was home and between the two of us we got it out of his throat. Really scary stuff. They’re not hard like a yak stick-more of a softer medium and the prongs can easily be snapped.

      "Comment: My two little Yorkies each get half a small dental stick after their morning breakfast, and they literally CRY and spin circles to remind me.  We've tried probably a dozen different dental chews in the past (in all price ranges), but we found a favorite in Get Naked.  We love all the recognizable ingredients, plus the vitamins and antioxidants added to these dental chews.  And they've never upset my one dog's highly sensitive tummy (which is rare).  And for two 5lb dogs chewing on these 5 minutes a day, the price is right.  Overall, my dogs love these more than their actual treats, and \"cleaning\" their teeth tartar is definitely the favorite part of their day.\n",

They seem to satisfy her insatiable chewing problem (at least for a few minutes), and her teeth are sparkly white with very little tartar build up. I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored). She seems to like the pink ones the most, but never turns away the other flavors (and she does turn away other brands of dental chews!). They are the ONLY treat that will get her to come back inside the fence when she's escaped, as well.\n",

I always cut them into severalpieces, and sometimes they were a little hard and I just splashed into the bag with a little water andsealed it up again, and then they had softened up enough to cut.  The sticks in this latest shipmentwere so hard that I was unable to soften them up, even after several infusions of water into the bag.This is absolutely unacceptable, particularly since they are freshness dated \"by Feb 25, 2025.  Mydentist told me that one of her dogs actually broke a tooth on these dental sticks!!These are supposed to be beneficial for dogs, and not so hard they are dangerous.I am sending the three bags that were in my last shipment to the company, since they are notreturnable to Amazon, but I am disappointed that Amazon is carrying something so obviouslynot up to their standards.I have been purchasing these dental sticks for years for my small Havanese dog.

Now there mostly dust and crumble with the slightest pressure. One of my ferrets won't eat them and shows no interest (but usually loves these) and I don't really feel comfortable feeding them to either because they look expired or poorly formulated. I don't know what happened. These are available with the usual consistency through Petco. Additionally, Amazon/seller won't accept return or replacement of this item in particular. (Though it says we still have about a month left for returns per Amazons policy, this seller doesn't allow returns/refunds.)\n",

      "Comment: I have purchased these many times as my ferret loves their chicken flavor treats. Oddly though, the last time I purchased 2 bags of the chicken flavor ones they looked darker, almost black. My ferret would not eat them. I already purchased the bacon flavor for him awhile ago and he would not eat those either. In the provided picture, the first bag (left) are the chicken ones I am referring to that I just bought and he won't eat. The bag in the middle is my last \"good\" ones I bought and the last time they shipped the ones he loved. Note that these are way lighter in color than the ones on the left. The bag on the right are the bacon ones he won't eat. So, in conclusion, the chicken bag ones on the left look exactly like the bacon ones in the bag on the right. I think they may have put the bacon flavor ones in the chicken bags by mistake. Now I am afraid to order more as I can't be sure they will be correctly packaged and Amazon will not accept returns for them. If you know ferrets, they can be very fussy regarding food and treats so I hope someone that can do something to fix this problem will see this review!\n",

      "Comment: Our 12 week old kitten has been eating these for a few weeks now and as his Mom, I feel really good about the ingredients and good amounts of protein, fat, and moisture in them. He's not food motivated at all and has been super accepting of his diet that includes free feeding good quality kibble with canned offered instead a few days a week. He definitely loves and wants that canned food but even then, never really eats with gusto. I say all this to explain that he just doesn't get all that excited over any food, but he does enjoy these treats.They are rather large, at least 5x the size of a single piece of kitten kibble, but no problem, because breaking these treats up is easy and makes treat time last a little longer.I also worried that these treats would arrive all smashed and broken as some reviewers have experienced, but that wasn't the case here. Lots of soft little hearts that I can break up myself.I feel good that I'm offering a healthy, low calorie treat, and that that my silly, wild, non-food-motivated little guy likes them enough to pause his crazy play time for one of these.\n",

They are super easy to break up into smaller pieces, so no issues there, I just wish the treats were a little smaller so I didn’t have to.For size comparison, I showed the treat next to her kitten food (Purina One Plus, healthy kitten formula)\n",

He struggles to chew them and ends up flinging them around the floor for a few minutes before he manages to bite it in the right way to break it up into smaller pieces.I'm also not sure if I got old stock or what, because they are a lot harder than I expected a soft treat to be.

      "Comment: I have had this on my Subscribe and Save for quite awule now. My dogs are not puppies, so I don't use these for \"puppy teething\". I give them pieces of these purely for healthy bedtime treats. I use kitchen shears to cut the rings into several pieces (each piece about an inch long).Then at bedtime, when my doggies are done eating for the day, they each get one piece. I feel the chewing motion helps clean their teeth and release healthy enzymes in their mouths. I love that the ingredients in these are so healthy and natural.And best of all my pups love their nighttime routine. They go out to potty, then race up on the porch and through the door to get their nightly pumpkin treats. Then time to snuggle with mommy & daddy!Oh, one more thing....once in awhile I get a bag where the rings are extra hard and brittle. When that happens, I just wet a clean paper towel, ring it out, then put it in the bag with the treats. I leave it sealed that way for about 24 hours. After that, they are more pliable and my kitchen shears cut through much better. And they are less brittle for my dogs' teeth that way too.\n",

They're the perfect texture between chewy and hard to keep her entertained for a good 10 minutes.Our pup always puts her ears back and closes her eyes when her teeth hurt and she's chewing on something that helps it. These help! The fact that they're curved into rings seems to really help her target whichever side of her mouth is hurting.That being said, these rings are HUGE. There are only 6 in a pack because they're so big, and the serving size starts at 1/4 a day?! So what, am I supposed to take the ring away after she's chewed through part of it? I did that and my dog tried to swallow the piece whole and choked on it. I got around that by just cutting the rings into quarter pieces (which takes a little patience).My pup LOVES these, especially the pumpkin, so I foresee getting these for the next few months, even when she's done teething.\n"

YES we knew what we were getting into but we LOVE our older one. I bought These the day we picked her up at ten weeks old and EIGHTEEN POUNDS. Every time she chews on something I stick a teething ring in her mouth. Pillows, blankets, shoes, fingers, whatever she gets a hold of I pull Her off and stick the teething ring in her mouth. In three days she has learned what is a good chew and what is a no chew. She loves them. I bought Four more bags. Our older Husky loves them too but they don’t last nearly as long with him. When I’m multitasking housework with puppy watching I wear The teething ring as a bracelet so if I catch Her doing something Nono I can Flip it off my wrist and in her mouth immediately. LOVE!!! Sell in bigger bags please!!!\n",

With a very young puppy- I start letting them chew down to half, then give second half later. As they get older, they get to chew a whole one. Nice variety of flavors available (mine likes them all). Have found them locally in the past (tho not reliably) so ordering was just easier this time. Also gifted some to a family member with a puppy and they were pleased too.\n",

It calms him an hour afterwards.,,,This occupies my 12 wk puppy for 20-30 minutes until he ferociously finishes it. My arms are saved from being bitten bloody during that time and for awhile after... so price is well worth it. The oils in the chew seem to numb his mouth. I have a high bite drive puppy from police line. Normal puppies could make this last much longer. He loves it far more than antler, bones, or skins (which are less appetizing than arms). It is safe for my dog to go wild on. Perhaps make sure your puppy is smart enough to gag himself should he shove down throat. ?\n",

A welcome change from some treats that smell horrible, if you know what I mean.2) I have two chihuahua puppies who NEVER sit still and who are NEVER quiet. Since giving them each a treat, I have enjoyed a full hour of total silence. They initially went NUTS over the treats, running all over the house waving them around-- then settled in and started chewing. They haven't stopped since. It's worth the asking price just to see them so content!3) The puppies obviously love the flavor. I'm buying more immediately.

Not the ideal ingredients.My advice, move to better brands that offer freeze-dried single ingredients. I am also trying Amazon brand WAG and excited to try the beef liver product.  I tossed it away after use it briefly, as it is best for my dog.\n",

Sukie was super energetic when she was in her puppy stage, and loved treats that she could spend some time chewing on. However, with the age, she grew out of it and it felt like she was uninterested no matter the efforts we made to find something appealing to her.As soon as I opened the bag and gave her a Senior Dental Ring, she sniffed, bit, and ran away with the treat! We think she was hiding it for later, to enjoy peacefully when nobody was around. I've never seen her getting so excited about a treat in these past few years, this was such a surprise! I'm happy we finally found something that she loves, and allows us to get a glimpse of the little playful puppy she used to be!\n",

I like that they are hard enough to where he has to chew but soft enough to bend and break. I’ve gotten every type of these and they are very consistent. It’s the only treat I’ve kept a reoccurring monthly sub for about a year now.I’ll be buying these again of course!\n",

If you have a dog over 50 pounds, these are pretty easy to serve.  However, you are supposed to give dogs under 50 pounds less than a full ring a day, and these are rather hard to break.  You may be able to cut them, but I didn't think to try that because I have large dogs, so I am not sure how well that would work.  Each ring is 112 kcals, which is slightly more than the kind we usually use, so I like to give these only occasionally.  The bag does list all of the important information I look for; ingredients, guaranteed analysis, calorie content, feeding guidelines and expiration date. The dogs did not have any adverse reactions to these dental rings.  Though I don't feel this is the healthiest option out there, the dogs really loved them and the treats are not super unhealthy so I will probably keep these on as an occasional option to change up our daily routine.\n",

      "Comment: N-Bone Adult Dental Rings Chicken Flavor Dog Treats were a huge hit with my boys. Even though the rings were made for adult dogs, they kept my two puppies busy for quite a while and took care of their \"itchy\" teeth; so these are perfect for teething puppies. The dental rings don't have a strong smell like bull pizzle or pig ears, additionally, they are free of many common allergens and the rings did an excellent job of reducing doggie breath, especially my oldest dog's \"guess what I found in the backyard\" breath. These chicken rings are definitely going into our treat rotation.The Bottom Line: The 7-count bag of N-Bone Chicken Flavor Adult Dog Dental Rings sells for $9.88, which is just $1.41 per treat which is less expensive, per treat, than the bulk treats at my LPS.\n",

I like the ingredients (mostly rice flour and gelatin, no weird ingredients), and they take a bit more time to chew than the usual dental chews I give them.  These did not cause any upset stomachs.The ingredients of these n-bones are pretty similar to those of Twistix, which I've been giving my dogs for years and years as well as the dogs for whom I dogsit.  So far no one has gotten an upset stomach from those, and I'm sure they'll be fine with these as well.  I like that there are no artificial colors in these!  Dogs do not care how their treats look!They're a bit big for my 20lb dog, although not if you ask him.  I was hoping I'd be able to break these rings in half, but they're way too hard to break.  He can handle the extra calories but these will have to be special treats for him and not every-day treats.\n",

Our expectation was that he would take a few minutes to gnaw on the treat or he wouldn't eat it at all. To our surprise, he almost inhaled the whole thing...and he did that every time he got one.

      "Comment: These dental rings came in a set of 7. Each ring is about 3.5”-4” in width and about ¼” thick and are pretty solid to the touch. It’s recommended that these are for dogs older than 1. We have 2 dogs- a pit bull and a Frenchie who can both chew threw almost anything. They ate these rings in about 2 minutes so they didn’t get much chewing time out of them unfortunately. I gave them one every other day until we ran out of the pack. I did notice a difference in their breath smelling better however I didn’t notice any changes in tartar or plaque build up but that’s probably because my dogs chew them too quickly. Overall, these are nice healthy treats for dogs and I would recommend them for dogs who aren’t fast chewers.\n",

      "Comment: These are good chewy treats for dogs, as they have a decent list of ingredients and our dog didn't seem to mind eating it. He's not a picky eater, but there are some treat flavors he won't eat. It didn't take him long to  make this ring-shaped chew disappear, maybe a full minute if that.  The package may say it's for 'strong' chewers, but it sure doesn't seem like it. Maybe it's also based on dog size?  Our American Bulldog is a big chonker, and he chewed through this treat like it was nothing more than a marshmallow. Our little ten pound Min Pin mix took a lot longer to devour her piece, but she also didn't have any trouble biting through the treat. Price here on Amazon is certainly better than the box box pet stores, where these bags sell for at least twice the price (at least around here in NY well outside of the city). We've bought these rings before as our A.B. loved their puppy teething rings when he was that age. They also have a pumpkin flavor, but we've yet to come across ANY dog - be it our own or that of friends or family or even shelter pups - that like that flavor.  But the chicken flavored chewy rings, like these, are quickly taken after a cursory sniff. Because of the higher calorie content, our dog only gets one or two a week and only on the days when we know he will be getting extra exercise.\n",

      "Comment: Well you’re here reading so I guess you are. Six years ago I decided to adopt cat. I didn’t know which one yet just that I wanted a cat in my life. I went to a local shelter and found one that I liked a lot. When I talked to the clerk there she told me that the little guy I liked was really sick, and that their vet couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. I got nervous about the costs associated with an undiagnosed illness, and when I made my thoughts known the clerk said “he’s not the cat for you.” I gave her this look of “excuse me?” And she continued saying, “when it’s your cat, you’ll know. And you won’t care what’s wrong or how much the medical bills might be, you’ll just know.” She suggested I go check out a couple other places and that if my heart was truly set on this little guy I could come back for him. Turns out she was right. He wasn’t the little guy for me, although I’m sure he found a very happy home. I went to another shelter that day and when I walked in, I turned to the cat room (it was very small and had no door) and started to go in. I remember the shelter was really loud. It was small so there wasn’t much of a barrier between the dogs and cats. But over all the chaotic noise I just heard this heartbreaking meow. I looked at the back of the room and there was this little grey floof meowing at the top of his lungs, standing up on his hind legs just staring at me. I immediately went over and got him out of the cage, and didn’t put him down again until we got home. I didn’t even ask if he’d had health issues, because that clerk was right. I didn’t care. Little did I know I chose a floof (named Jasper) that would end up with some serious health issues, costing around $6000 for the hospital stay and surgery, and expensive prescription food thereafter. Jasper had crystals in his bladder that he was unable to pass through his urethra. He almost died when it was at its worst, and even though it was suggested to me to put him down, I told the vet to try anything he could to save him. The surgery has a 50% success rate which is not great, but it was a success for Jasper. However, he now needs some special care to ensure he stays healthy. Although the prescription food helped immensely, I noticed he was still having digestive issues, and has had a couple of flare ups with his bladder. I tried so many different things but nothing really worked until I found these random cranberry treats on amazon. I figured, what the heck. Might as well. And they were a godsend. Not only is Jasper OBSESSED with these treats, but they help him so much! As long as I consistently give him these treats he doesn’t get bladder flare ups, and he throws up a lot less (now it’s just the occasional hairball for which I started using Loxatene). In general they just keep him much healthier and happier, and they’re ten times better than the royal canine prescription treats. A few months back they stopped selling these, and immediately Jasper started having some issues again. I’m so glad they’re back in stock, and I hope they stay that way. If your cat has urinary tract issues, I am begging you, try these! It is absolutely and by far the best product for kitty UT issues on the market. Quality ingredients, and proven to work. And for the record, I am not being paid or sponsored for this review. I just truly truly believe in this company and these treats after everything Jasper and I have been through. Anyway, if you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading, and try the treats.\n"

      "Comment: So I cannot attest to the flavor quality as I have not eaten these myself but my chonky boy cat really enjoys gobbling them down like gummy bears. As he's getting on his years and UTIs are an issue for male cats I try to give these to him daily. At 16 lbs he gets about 12 of these per day, I throw them across the room and he screams joyfully as he flies upwards, getting several feet of air. Sometimes one gets under a bookcase and then he goes mad trying to pry his precious out from under the thieving piece of furniture. I don't dare go near the bag when it's not Treat Time as he will get all riled up and becomes utterly unbearable.The weird thing is initially when I first got these he did not care for them. I didn't give him any for a few weeks and suddenly he developed a taste for them, I'm not sure what kitty crack they put in these things.My other cat does not care for these. One sniff and she turns to me with this annoyed face like I'm wasting her valuable cat-time.So your cat's reactions to this will vary (every kitty is an individual and she/he has different preferences). If they don't like it, try again later or give it to another fellow cat owner to enjoy.Edit: I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.It's 10 months since my previous review and my cat still loves them! And they help keep his weight down as we have made a game where I shake the bag (and he gets all crazy because he has the exact sound of the bag memorized) before throwing the treat for him to catch/find. I throw him a couple throughout the day so he gets his 9-12 minimum and they keep him active and healthy. The treats are also a nice small size so he doesn't have to struggle at all (senior kitties sometimes have teeth issues so he tries and gives up on the bigger treats that require chewing). I hope the company never changes the formula!\n",

      "Comment: We have a couple older kitties, and we've transitioned them to \"urinary health\" diets. This means out with the old treats (which were likely okay), and in with treats for cats with FLUTD.Our cats totally ignored these treats. Even when hungry, they hardly even sniff them, and have not eaten a single treat. So, one can infer that at least some cats don't like these alleged \"treats\". From that, one can safely conclude that for those cat owners, this is $6 wasted.Yes, cats can be persnickety, and maybe change their minds about things. Our cats are somewhere in the middle of that continuum, but when it's dinner time, and the treats aren't even sniffed at, I think that's a good sign that the treats ... aren't \"treats\".I should also mention that we've tried many different brands of treats down through the years, and none have been so roundly rejected as these. So, you can take your chances buying these. They are roughly double the price of typical treats.\n",

She has recurrent UTI's and has regular visits to the vet for antibiotic courses to treat the infections, but she has generally been very low energy and strains to pee quite often. I bought these treats as a last ditch effort to see if the cranberries could help keep the acidity up in her urinary tract to prevent bacterial growth because that's a home remedy my mom brought up for when people get UTIs as well. After a week of feeding her these treats and not changing her diet/any other significant lifestyle factors, her personality and mood and urinary habits have transformed significantly, and I'm so happy she's doing better. I didnt realize that there were also so many vitamins in these treats too, and I think they've also helped make a big difference.

She had blood in her urine and I bought these same day and fed her like a prescription 8-9 treats 3 times a day.  By day 3, I would have taken her to the vet, but she started drinking more water(I put 1 large coffee mug of water on each of my night stands) as she likes to hang out in my bed.  I would suggest more water bowls where they are, as she wouldn’t walk to the kitchen for her water fountain! Baby was sick. Like humans we don’t get out of bed sick.  These are absolutely a game changer and my pet insurance many pets pays for these as a holistic treat option.  I now give her these daily for maintenance to help bacteria in the urine along with Iams uti food or a UTI food. Like a regular antibiotic they take time to full heal.  Per medical medium- cranberry is a natural antibiotic for streptococcus bacteria which causes UTI.All the best with your fur baby-Ms. Nika’s mommy\n",

      "Comment: I tried these treats in hope of replacing Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Adult Cat Treats, which can be very difficult to find. My cat's on a strict urinary tract health diet and I supplement his regular food with treats throughout the day.He didn't go for these at first, which was an early bad sign as he usually gobbles up treats. Ingredients say these have chicken as the primary ingredient, which he loves. So it's curious why he wouldn't take to them. After a couple more tries, he started eating them, but didn’t seem too enthusiastic.Another issue: I ordered 3 bags to take advantage of a 3-for-the-price-of-2 checkout coupon. I got 3 bags, but only 2 contained the full 2.5 ounces of treats. The 3rd bag is about a third full, despite being in the same packaging as the other two. It clearly doesn't contain the listed 2.5 ounces. It's not that big a deal, considering I paid for 2 and got a little more than 2 bags' worth, but still, it makes me question if the company's not playing fast and loose in other ways.And, as others have noted, despite the Amazon listing, there's nothing on the product's packaging that specifically says these treats are good for a urinary tract health diet. Are they really? Can you believe the ingredient listing at all?Considering these issues together, it makes me question if I can trust the company and their product claims. It all seems shady. Therefore I don't think I'll ever order these again for my cat.\n"

      "Comment: I honestly can't rate these cat treats on how they affect a cats urinary health. My cat never had any urinary problems before eating these, and she has none now either. The treats themselves are crunchy, small and heart shaped. My cat doesn't love these (like she does some others... as she's \"tempted\" by another kind). She is though happy to have something different than just her regular food. These are well priced, although I'd like to make a suggestion to you all. I have purchased a bag of dry food, different than her regular, daily kibble (I bought it here, on Amazon). I use it as a \"treat\" for her, and whatever I give her, I subtract the same amount from her daily ration. This way, she thinks that she's getting her treats, but won't put on extra weight (which so many cats do, for this reason alone). It'll also save ALOT of money considering, for instance that a five pound bag of dry food would equal more than 20 bags of treats. Whoa, that's alot of money! My daughter turned me on to this idea, and I think she's pretty amazing for thinking of it. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy these, especially if their cat does have urinary issues. But, I can't say that they would have any effect on it. Possibly checking with your cat's vet might be a good idea.\n",

      "Comment: My young male cat had blood in his urine, couldn't void completely, and had crystals. Honestly, I didn't think he'd make it. It's a multi-cat household, so I didn't catch his problem until it was dire. We already had a cat fountain, but added water dishes throughout the house and immediately switched to Purina Pro Plan for urinary health (he refuses wet food). One weird trick that worked to increase hydration was to sprinkle water onto cat grass before letting him nibble it. I ordered these treats because he loves snacks and already felt deprived from the new food and miserable from the crystals. I was told eating smaller meals more frequently helps control urine pH. He loves them! I have to hide the bag so he won't bite into it and help himself. I can't say whether the snacks help, but they don't appear to hurt. He's on the mend and is even playing with the other cats. However, if you're on the fence about these treats, it's true they are a love or hate thing. While the cat with urinary issues loves these, every other cat rejects them. I don't know whether there is something in them the one cat instinctively senses will help or he's just less picky. The size of the treats and crunch factor seems about the same as other treats. The recommended daily amount for a small cat is 5-6 per day (twice that for a large cat), so while the package is small, I think they will last a while. The ingredient list looks healthy, so I feel good giving them to him.\n"

This cat is a carb addict and refuses wet food, so I have to settle with a kibble designed for urinary tract health. Recently, I decided to get him on a VERY high, very expensive quality dry kibble. After several weeks on the new food and after multiple tests with a pH strip, I started noticing the pH of his urine became very basic instead of acidic, which is where it needs to be. I decided I'd try these to see if it helped so I could keep him on the new food because I adore the ingredients. I fed him the serving size every day for a week, continued testing his urine and didn't notice a difference in the pH. I think all these did was just make him a little fatter. Great.

      "Comment: After 2 rounds of antibiotics our cat could not seem to shake a constant UTI following becoming stressed out over some home remodeling we were doing. Always up until then he was perfect with the litter box but because he felt so bad he had to show us how he was feeling, we were beside ourselves on what to do. Finally I did some research and found these treats, I figured if cranberry was good for this problem in people maybe it would work on the cat. Since we started giving him these treats he is back to his old self! No blood in his urine, no whimpering because he is in pain, and no tinkling outside the box. I can't praise these enough! For the record he is already on prescription UTI food and it also didn't seem to solve the problem. These did! I hope my review helps another family in search of a solution for this problem.\n",

These were super affordable so I decided there's no harm in trying them. She absolutely loves these treats. Everytime I open a bag of anything she gets excited and thinks it's these treats. I'm using these to train her to sit in laps. They smell kind of good and not gross like cat food does. As far as if they are helping her kidneys I don't know but she really, really likes them.

I desperately needed an effective way to improve my older dog's teeth (and Bark Bright REALLY works!) but I didn't want to spend that much on my puppy yet ($25/month) nor did I want her to have 75+ extra calories (although I did a few times break the Bark Bright sticks in smaller halves for her when I didn't have alternative yet).These puppy chews seem to be tasty to BOTH my dogs, and they are always happy to have them.  They do not last more than A MINUTE or TWO (maybe 2 with my puppy, but definitely less than 1 minute for my 7 year old husky shepherd mix).These are \"small\" and there are about 16-18 sticks per bag, so they are a good alternative (only about 27 calories per stick) for my puppy as my older dog gets his Bark Bright stick every morning.

      "Comment: This is a wonderful treat for not only my Aussie puppy (Fed from 2.5 months ~ 4 months), but also for my 11 year old rescue who has teeth problems. We spend a lot of money on dental work for her, because even with regular teeth brushing and check ups, her age and genetics gave my poor senior dog serious teeth problems. For my puppy, I like that she's getting her teeth cleaned while giving me 20 minutes of respite from her antics. Nice to see her chomp on something other than my bum or ankles :). Yay! My senior dog with missing teeth takes about 40 minutes, but she looks forward to it every day. We're happy when she's happy! We still brush her teeth daily, but it's great that she gets as much support as possible for her dental health. The ingredients are healthy, and it's great seeing their poop continue to stay regular and healthy!\n",

I don't think this cleans teeth very well, so make sure to be brushing your dogs teeth regularly (as any responsible dog parent should be). This does however, do wonders for stinky breath. If you're not brushing your dog's teeth then the smell may continue despite using these, due to the plaque buildup. But overall just pair these with daily brushing, and your dog's teeth will be shining! (and smell good too)\n",

They seem to satisfy her insatiable chewing problem (at least for a few minutes), and her teeth are sparkly white with very little tartar build up. I like that they have GOOD things inside, not random yucky bits like so many dog treats. We've gone through ten packs of these in various flavors and will continue to buy them for her as long as she continues to love them (we rotate flavors so she doesn't get bored). She seems to like these pink ones the most, but never turns away the other flavors (and she does turn away other brands of dental chews!).

They don’t smell bad - they just have a peculiar smell that’s different from most products like this. These seemed to last a bit longer than other teething treats we tried, which I really like!\n",

      "Comment: I thought I had found the perfect treat when I ran into these for my 8 week old puppy. He was teething very bad so I thought these could help him and I was a big fan of the natural ingredient claim with the added benefit. I made a mistake of not checking the ingredients. I don't understand who would put peppermint oil in a dog treat. This is absolutely toxic for any dog. Peppermint oil should not even be on your dog's skin let alone get ingested. I have been feeding this to my puppy for a few weeks now until I realized this. I am throwing them out immediately. I wanted to let people know out there that this is not good for your dog and it should not be fed to them. This company should really consider taking this ingredient out and then I may purchase this again.\n",

I gave my pup one of the chicken flavored chew sticks this morning.  She chewed the stick in about 10 minutes and appeared to really enjoy it.  However, as soon as she finished, she immediately started to whine and cry, letting me know she wanted to get out of her crate.  I opened the crate and she ran to get a drink of water and headed right for the door.  I opened the door and let her out to her soiling area where she made a quick pee before making a very loose, watery poop!! I am extremely disappointed in this product and regret purchasing a 3-pack of the 6 oz. che sticks.  What a waste of money and an unpleasant experience for my young pup.\n",

I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.  It seriously hurts their feelings if I try.So, the 12-year-old thoroughly enjoys these puppy treats also. :)This is a great price when you buy them in a three pack.

      "Comment: As of writing this, I have a 8-week-old chihuahua puppy that's about 1-2 pounds. She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case.

However, reading the ingredients for the older version and the new version, they are identical but the treats themselves are NOT the same. The Chicken flavored product used to be a brown color and both our ferrets loved those treats. We recently purchased the Chicken flavor treats again and they were the same dark brown (nearly black) color of the Bacon flavored treats.

Ferrets are obligate carnivores and cannot digest vegetables, starch, etc. They also contain vegetable glycerin (essentially sugar), and sugar has been shown to cause insulinoma and/or make it worse. Consider buying freeze-dried treats (there are some marketed for cats but only contain meat and are safe).\n",

That’s when I discovered these.They are semisoft and apparently taste pretty  good. Her sensitive (and adorable) tummy isn’t giving either of us any more trouble.\n"

Lol They are a bit small or skinny so good size for even teacup size dogs like even below 3lbs( had a Yorkie that was 2 1/2lbs, Hadley, before i got Viserys, my Shih Tzu)but I would suggest that you watch or moderately supervise your dog while he/she eats them. I have heard reports that some dogs have choked or got them stuck in their mouths and throats. So to be safe, make sure your dog is in eyes view of you while he treats himself to these. They are apparently tasty to them. I started giving him the peanut butter ones for a bit of variety and now he won’t eat any more of both flavors. Lol I may have just gave them to him a bit too much and he got tired of them too quickly but everything seemed fine before the peanut butter ones. Came to find out he had been hiding them away in the folds of his bed. I go to clean his bed out and i find all these sticks! He was eating them at first seemed to love them.

It looked like she had a cigarette (kinda funny!) and it lasted maybe 10 minutes. Then, we lost the bag somewhere in the house. Now that she's 8-lbs, it looks like she can eat the whole bag in one hour. The bones are about 1/4-inch wide. So, we are cutting the treats in half and putting them outside for the squirrels, who might find them too small too. To be fair, there are a good amount of treats in the bag. Our puppy was attracted to the flavor right away. But she is too big to enjoy its chewing fun and value. XXS puppies need teething treats too, which is why we gave it 4-stars.\n",

I know he loves them and when he gets his he walks so proud and happy, because he is definitely relieved of the feelings. I know he has a while to go but these are a big part in his growing process and especially his teething situation. Have to give them a 4 of 5 only because the longevity factor does not apply to these. I'd definitely recommend. Aries is Happily teething and growing and trying to gnaw and chew every little thing lol. Thanks for being a part of our new additions growing process.\n",

I don't think they do much for satisfying the need to chew, as there are better options for that, but they are a nice treat.  There are puppy teething rings made by this same company which last a bit longer - but they also cost more and you don't get very many in a package.  I use those when I have them for the same purpose of settling my puppy down at bedtime, but they also don't do much to satisfy the need to chew, despite the name of the product.

I have two King Charles Cavaliers and used these for both when they were puppies and I also used them for the litter of pups we just had. For a small breed dogs and young pups these do work great for teething. I gave them to the pups when they started getting teeth and they were unable to \"eat\" them yet but they loved the taste and it did help them with teething. Once they got older and were able to eat them it was more of a reward yes but it still helped with their back teeth which take the longest time to \"pop out\".

      "Comment: So, the super finicky felines that rule the house can, coincidentally, be super finicky about their treats. One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.\n",

At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be. Might give it a few days and see if she wants to try at least the furball treats again, but it does look like the health treats are a lost cause for both cats.\n",

Every cat loves these treats! We are always trying to find treats that’s good for them and are delicious. These treats get a 10/10 in my book.Can’t recommend them more 😍\n",

      "Comment: I wanted to find a soft treat for my cats that was healthy and had cranberry in it that my cats would both eat. That is tricky nowadays having two cats with different tastebuds. However ever since I’ve found this on a pet store shelf I will search until I can get my hands on it! I only can find it online now but it makes me feel better that my cats are getting a healthy treat in them that hopefully will help prevent issues down the line.\n",

      "Comment: So, the super finicky felines that rule the house can, coincidentally, be super finicky about their treats. One will throw up if he gets more than 2-3 at one time, another looks at them and gives me a blank look as if asking “What did you just try to pawn off on me?”, and then there’s the third one that is all-the-treats-all-the-time. So I have a hard time finding treats that they will all like or at least two out of three. So what did they think of these?Smell (that’s mostly me): On the mild side. Didn’t really smell like chicken to me.Hard/soft: Very soft. Two of the cats seemed to eat them okay, but the one that’s missing most of her teeth had trouble with them.Taste (that’s them): they seemed a bit dubious and I think that might be down to the mild smell. While they did eat them, the toothless one was the slower of the three to jump on them.Overall: I like that this product is made in the USA and it’s for all life stages since ours range from 4-11yo. I’ve also found that they do seem to enjoy cranberry when it’s in their foods, which is always a bonus for me (and them). And at the listed price, it’s about on par with other similar products out there. In looking at the brand, I also see that there’s other flavor options, which I intend to investigate.\n",

      "Comment: We have six cats and Temptations are their kitty crack of choice, but these far-healthier Naked Biteables are beloved by Woodrow and Wolfie, brothers who are prone to minor but regular UTIs. These treats contain cranberry and that's exactly what they need in their diet to make sure they don't develop problems.While I do add a powder UTI supplement to their food at meals, I love that they come running for these treats several times a day as well. It helps keep them safe and happy.Not all of the other four like them but that's fine. The two that benefit most absolutely love them and I love giving them to them.\n"

      "Comment: Based on both cats loving the purple furball soft-treats made by the same company, I thought I'd give the health soft-treats a try. At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be. Might give it a few days and see if she wants to try at least the furball treats again, but it does look like the health treats are a lost cause for both cats.\n",

      "Comment: We have a multiple dog household.A 12-year-old, and a three month old Australian shepherd/border collie mix.Well, when we give one a treat, we have to give both of them a treat. And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product. I wish it would’ve worked out better for us. :-)\n",

Now within the first five minutes he has broken the ring and goes from chewing to eating.-when the ring comes in contact with saliva it gets really really sticky. A mess for humans to pick up by hand-as a dog chews/eats it, little clumps get dislodged everywhere, radioactive yellow colored. Had to pick up.-it gets stuck in pups teeth once in smaller chunks, leading to dog running around the house trying to paw/dislodge by themselves. Needs human to actually dislodge.\n",

      "Comment: We have a 16 week old mini schnauzer puppy who loves these things. Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the \"teeth sinking\" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains.\n",

Those are WAY too big for her. I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues. All in all, they're a bit pricey but worth it.\n",

He only eats hard food so I was very surprised! I have introduced the rings to him several times over the past 8 weeks.  It hasn’t improved.These teething rings are too large and too hard for small breed puppies. However, they would probably be great for larger breeds.So!

I think he swallows too soon and doesn’t chew it down enough. Either way he will throw up chunks of it all night long. So I threw the rest away. I even tried holding it and letting him teeth on it that way but he was still trying to eat too large of pieces. They don’t even look like they have digested much at all when they come out. Even if its been 8 hrs since he ate it. But he loved the taste! So if your dog is good at chewing things up, I would recommend.

      "Comment: We have a multiple dog household.A 12-year-old, and a three month old Australian shepherd/border collie mix.Well, when we give one a treat, we have to give both of them a treat. And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product. I wish it would’ve worked out better for us. :-)\n",

Now within the first five minutes he has broken the ring and goes from chewing to eating.-when the ring comes in contact with saliva it gets really really sticky. A mess for humans to pick up by hand-as a dog chews/eats it, little clumps get dislodged everywhere, radioactive yellow colored. Had to pick up.-it gets stuck in pups teeth once in smaller chunks, leading to dog running around the house trying to paw/dislodge by themselves. Needs human to actually dislodge.\n",

      "Comment: We have a 16 week old mini schnauzer puppy who loves these things. Part of it is definitely that he can sink his teeth into it multiple times (kinda like a hard wax texture?), part of it is the shape due to how he tosses it, and another must be the flavor.  Thankfully it doesn't smell as bad as the bully stick nor the cod skins we have.  The cod skins do not offer the \"teeth sinking\" feeling this does, and while bully sticks do they stink so much.I would note that these rings do leave a sticky hard residue, likely from the rice flour or maybe the gelatin as it reminds me of how my hands feel after getting dried over cooked rice on clothing. His beard and paws feel crunchy afterwards and this can also end up on you, clothing, and furniture. We find this a very fair trade for the length of time this has entertained our landshark puppy though when compared to the smells of bully sticks and codskins (or the left over scales). Some hot water on a wash rag can clean it up easily without stains.\n",

      "Comment: My maltipoo pup loves these. I had ordered the tiny dog size when she first started teething, then mistakenly ordered the regular sized ones during Amazon's Pet Days event. Those are WAY too big for her. I made do by cutting those in half until we used them all up, but the tiny puppy ones are just the right size.When she was younger, a ring would keep her occupied for a good 30 mins or more. Now at eight months of age with all her permanent teeth either fully in or growing in, it takes her maybe 15 minutes to finish one off. Still a good busy-time treat while I'm on Zoom calls or as a reward for really good behavior, but I do wish they were a little bit longer lasting.These are also made in the U.S., which is important to me after so many imported pet treats have caused health issues. All in all, they're a bit pricey but worth it.\n"

      "Comment: I have two cats. One of them played with these sticks for a little while but didn't seem to figure out they were chewable, even when I stuck them in his mouth. Oh well, he's a little dumb anyway.The other cat LOVES them. She needs her stick fix every day. She gets one at 6pm and the other around midnight, and she knows it - when the time comes she'll go to the kitchen counter and start meowing and begging for them. Sometimes she plays fetch with the stick, but most of the time we throw it for her, she runs after it, grabs it and starts chowing down. She even figured out how to stick one end into the high pile carpet so that she can keep it stable while she gnaws on the other end. They seem to be doing a good job of keeping my girl cat's teeth clean; we have to give dental treats and water additives for the other cat. We've been subscribed to these sticks for over a year now and she goes through about three packs a month.So your mileage may vary with these sticks. From my sample size of 2, there's a 50% chance of stick addiction and 50% chance that they'll totally flop. Even so, I have to give them 5 stars because of how much my girl loves them. If they ever discontinue these, I'm going to have a very unhappy cat on my hands.Oh, and the first few times you give these to your cat, keep a close eye on them. My cat has never choked in her 1 year plus of eating these every day, but she has taken bites that were too large and immediately vomited them up after - I guess the large chunks didn't sit well in her stomach. If you have a very small kitten, they may choke.\n"

He chew through 2 sticks but the 3rd time I tried to give him one he turned away from it. I gave one to the dog to show him they're the same thing but time after time he still turned away from it.I do know cats don't normally find \"chew\" toys necessary since cats don't typically chew in the same way dogs do. So perhaps this bone broth stick is just too hard for cats in general. But i think tbr taste is fine bc other animals in the house see it as a treat. in the end I turned to just finding some some what mildly freezed dried meat treats for his chewy-like behavior.Dogs however love the bone broth stick. I gave the rest of the bag to a toy poodle owner and her 2 dogs loved them. So 3 stars for decent dog treats that has the word cat on the bag. I don't think it's a bad treat, just not for cats.\n",

      "Comment: When I first bought these my cat really wasn’t that interested, but she warmed up to these. This has been a lifesaver for me because my cat has a G.I. issue and I have realize that when she starts trying to chew everything in my home office while I’m working, that it’s because her tummy is aggravating her. I now leave the sticks in my desk and when she starts chewing on my artificial plants and papers and pens, I offer her a stick and she now comes running. The downside is that she can’t hold it on her own without me holding it. However, it absolutely does the trick  and stops her from Destroying my house and eating something that she is not supposed to eat. She’s also fine with just less than one stick per day.It’s surprisingly sit well on her stomach as well and that makes me happy, because there’s not a lot of treats out there that she can have with a diet that she’s on. I don’t think of these like a cat treat, but more of a chew therapy for a cat that needs to chew on some thing. Hope this helps people in similar situations. Best advice, offer it to your cat when you see them chewing because they are more likely to try it and once they try it they may like it more. Again I would not offer this as just an occasional every day treat, as there are probably better ones out there if your cat does not have stomach issues.\n",

We've been sticking them near things that he likes to chew on, and evidently they're a bit more enticing because he's been leaving the other stuff around the house alone. He seems to really enjoy biting bits off so there are little pea-sized nodules peppered around the area but he's no longer putting himself at risk by chewing on electrical cords so I consider this an absolute success. Plus it seems that it's fun to play with because even the ones he's knocked loose from the places we've wedged them he'll roll around on and kick. Definitely recommend for chewers.\n",

He is a 13 week main coon/bengal tabby mix, and he still hasn't mastered how to chew on the stick but he loves the flavor and is definitely interested in them. The stick themselves ARE soft enough for a cat to break the stick down with bites and chunks. If you do own a cat that is a chewer, then you may want watch them, just so they don't choke. I'm glad that it is easy for the cat to chew but not too soft that Mr. Biggles looses interests or eats them and moves on. Considering that there are enough chew bones in a 3.37 oz package, being that they are 4\" sticks each, I feel that they will last several month. Mr. Biggles is teething, but that much of a chewer. Being that these are all natural and made in the USA, this makes the product an even more handsome buy. ***Edit Review**** My. Mr. Biggles eats the stick in 4 minutes or less. He mastered this by 7 months old. They are his 2nd favorite to chew on, 1st is bison lung. He has clean teeth and no bad breath. I moved on to bully and raw hide, it lasts longer.\n",

      "Comment: My cats LOVED these as soon as they smelled them! Fantastic idea for teething kittens. My kitten won't use any teething toys, but he loves these!I don't really understand how someone can complain about there being more wheat and corn than chicken in this. They are supposed to be hard to wear down. I can't see this being possible with chicken being the primary ingredient. The formulation is perfectly right for what the product actually IS. Your cat isn't going to sit there and eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I'm pretty sure a little more wheat and corn than chicken isn't going to kill them.If you don't like the idea of your cats chewing on anything that isn't pure meat, you're not going to find anything like this usable. If your cat is allergic, you already know they are because you'll have to purchase special food for them, as well. N.y cats eat natural food, where meat is the primary ingredient, and there's still some veggies and grains in there, because in general they are GOOD for them and make up part of a well balanced diet.If your cat has allergies, though, you'll be happy to know there are catnip sticks on Amazon, too, which are literally sticks that have been broken off from the plant. Problem solved.This product though doesn't deserve the bashing another reviewer here gave it. My cats love it, they love their food too for that matter (they were the ones that picked it), and they're healthy. That's all I can really ask for.\n",

      "Comment: I had mixed feelings after reading the reviews on this about purchasing. My cat is a biter and LOVES to chew on a good (iPhone) cord or paper. I tried buying him a chicken flavored plastic dog bone, but I think it was too big for him to put around his mouth and actually chew on. The first time I tried to give this to my cat, Stan, he didn't really know what to do with it. He licked it a little bit and was just over it. I thought it was a failure. Then one day, he was play biting at me on the couch and I put the bone in place of my finger and he started chewing it. It took a LONG time of me holing the bone/treat while he chewed away for him to finish the first one, I was also a little concerned when it got broken down into a smaller size that it could be a choking hazard, but it's been fine. He just started his second treat and this time he knew what he was doing and at half of it in one sitting. I think it was a successful purchase for me, but I'm sure it's totally dependent on the cat.\n",

I have 3 cats and it's like none of them understand the concept of this stick type treat.  If your cats are the type to eat jerky, maybe they would be right for those type cats.  Think mine may just be lazy, cause our dogs love them.  Too expensive to buy for dogs though.. I gave them 4 stars because I don't think anything is wrong with them.  Just maybe wrong animal.  I bought because I felt the concept is good.  Cats get bored with just treat pieces sometimes.  I think if these had a stronger smell and were less bound by a waxy covering my cats would like them better.  Too hard for most cats I feel because cats are pretty lazy and get bored working for food too much.  If I had one cat I would be more guarded with my review of these, but all three cats do the same.. But if you also have a dog they won't be wasted...\n"

These are 100% a treat that needs to be supervised, but I loved that it was a challenge for them to chew through and that they had to put some effort in. It’s not rock hard like I’ve seen other reviews say, it can bend and be broken with some effort, but definitely isn’t some thing they can chew through in just a couple bites.

      "Comment: Well, the good news is that I can give these to my cat when she starts to chew the pens and pencils in my pencil cup on my desk. The bad news is that she only chews these if I literally stick them in her mouth. She doesn't seem to care for the flavor (if there is any), and if I'm not actively giving it to her, she's only interested in it as a toy to knock off the desk. It's been a few months, and she's really only gnawed a bit at the end of one stick. The only saving grace for this product is that I feel safer using it as a chewing distraction (I can't imagine that the metal/plastic of pens and pencils is any good for her if it breaks off in her mouth). Sadly, I'm not really sure why dogs have a plethora of enticing chewing options but cats only have little dental treats.\n",

That is the only reason they are four stars instead of five. However, they work as advertised as dental treats. My little guy had tartar issues that led to bad breath and having two of his teeth pulled (not the fangs, thank goodness). Talked to the vet about how to improve, and she suggested chew treats. I had already tried Greenies, but my greedy cat gobbled them whole without chewing them. Definitely needed something in stick form that he would have to pull apart. Stumbled across these on Amazon and they work great. No more bad breath, and more importantly, no more dental issues. He gets a clean bill every checkup! He is actually scheduled to have his teeth cleaned once a year, but the vet recommended skipping the last time because his teeth were in such great shape.

So I was actually excited when I found a treat with a lot of complaints that cats found it too difficult to eat. Finally, something he can’t scarf down in mere seconds! So I gave him his first treat and timed how long it took him to eat it. One minute and fifty-six seconds. He was a super determined and single-minded about it, and he is a large cat so I am sure that made it easier for him. It didn’t take him nearly as long as I had hoped, but it kept him occupied longer than anything else I have found, and let him take out some of his need to chew on something he is actually allowed to chew. So overall a win!He is almost 12 years old so age doesn’t seem to be an issue in his case.If your cat isn’t very food-driven or doesn’t love to chew, this is probably not an appropriate treat for them.\n",

Try holding it for him while he chews it up.  The cat chews are meant to be pliable.  Too dry?  Just wrap in a moistened paper towel and keep in the fridge for 24 hours.  They soften right up.  My cat goes on the hunt for something to chew on.  He sniffs the power cord smelling for one that is not sprayed with bitter apple.

      "Comment: I can't give the sticks 5 stars because out of my pride of cats, most don't like these sticks. However, when you have 2 who like to play fetch, and gnaw on things because they're young and full of energy and like to chew on things they shouldn't, they love these. I will add though, that they do like Sentry Petrodex VS Dental Twist Treats better, but I want to make sure there's something for them to chew and give them options. The other cats besides these two, just stare at the sticks and walk away after sniffing them. Putting it into their food dish isn't even a good hint. So, your cat will either really love them or really hate them. It only takes one bag to find out.\n",

These treats sounded like something that he could really work on and satisfy his chewing urges thereby saving our shoestrings, hoodie pulls and cords. He carried the stick around all over the house, put it in a shoe and licked then gnawed on it for about 10 minutes before giving up and leaving it sticky and melding into the carpet.\n"

      "Comment: I was trying various \"stick\" type treats for my cat since those are his favorite; he loves chewing, and I was hoping to find some that gave him a little more to chew on and not be scarfed down. Well, these are not it, because he didn't even register that it was food. He sniffed it, and then rubbed his face on it and walked off.Ok, I certainly don't blame a product for my cat not liking it; cats can have different taste just like people. As I do with many treats my cat doesn't care for, I tried giving it to my neighbor's outdoor cat who visits daily (needless to say, for treats). She was completely uninterested. I laid it on the doormat thinking she might go for it eventually, and I had to go back to work and forgot about it. Over the next couple hours, not one but two of my neighbor's dogs came by (up to my door, where they stare intently at my cat through the screen). The NEXT DAY, after which who knows what else (including y'know, bugs and other wildlife) could have eaten the blasted thing, there it was, whole, on my door mat.I'm not positive what is in this, but whatever it is, it must be really, really unappetizing.\n",

She'd pick them up in her mouth but they didn't seem to register as food unless I gave her a very, very small chunk, which is extremely hard to do. I recently bought a brand name version of a \"chicken stick\" and she went absolutely crazy for it and gobbled it right up. The texture was noticeably better as well.So if you want a hard stick your cat can throw around this will fit that bill, but otherwise it just wasn't worth it.\n",

My main problem with these is that my cat easily ate them in just a few seconds. Although it doesn't specifically say that they are particularly hard, I inferred it from the fact that they're \"chew treats\". I thought it was the type of thing the cat could gnaw on for some time, which I was hoping would help channel at least a bit of my cats oral fixation on something better than my flesh or furniture.

Got them 5 years ago with the same results for my sister's kitten I was watching while she was deployed. They held more interest when fresh and soft... Once opened and out of the package, they hardened and had to be tossed in a few days.Got 2 kittens this past week, and again--in need of something to shove in their mouth when they go after my fingers. They are a hit with these babies!I feed high quality pet food and treats, and while the ingredients in this don't fit my normal standards, I want something for a few months that they can gnaw on and won't cause blockages if ingested. The majority of toys for kittens are either too soft for teething or hazardous when viciously chewed.  This is a perfect compromise--won't harm teething kittens.\n",

She didn't like them right away but after she started to spend some time on them, they started to dissolve and she could chew on them more easily. These treats are great for distracting dogs but you also have to be careful if they're a smaller dog because the treat is really hard and I could see it could cause choking in over ambitious dogs that don't take the time to break down the treat. The only flaw in these treats is that my dog has a beard and these treats get really milky and foamy and once she finishes her treat it looks like she has rabies and that she's foaming at the mouth. I always find chunks of unfinished twistix dental chews melted to her beard with foam. She loves them so much and they're good for her teeth so I can't complain.

I prefer the smell (and her breath) after eating the vanilla mint, but as far as the dog is concerned, she eats both flavors with equal enthusiasm.Original Review...............My dog loves Twistix but twice now, she's thrown up a couple hours after having one at bed time.  We normally give her the vanilla mint version which she's eaten for over a year without any issues.  For some reason, the yogurt banana version doesn't agree with her system.

      "Comment: Living with a four dog pack as I do, daily brushing can become routine and cumbersome (I do it in the pm with Virbac Vanilla Mint enzymatic toothpaste which they love and which actually contributes to teeth health whether you brush or just swipe it through on a swab - enzymatic, so if you are introducing the idea or have a non cooperative dog it might be a good thing to check out as well for those reasons) so I look for fun ways to add to the process of canine teeth cleaning. I read an article somewhere about this product that made me look into it further. Note here, I am all about natural raw feeding, integrative vet care, wholesome ingredients and positive training and keeping up with new ideas like Reiki for animals. (It really works!).I bought the small chews for my standard size dogs (50 - 70 pounds) because I don't give large treats but prefer to parcel them out. Perfect size. After their breakfast they each get a chew stick and they love them. I feed them in their crates and the floor gets a bit slimy because they break off bits and shove them around but with crate feeding (the rare times the dogs use the crates anymore) the floors get cleaned up anyway. You can smell the cinnamon which I know is good for breath and other ailments in humans as well. One of my concerns with these dental type chews in the past has been the possibility of blockages and these appear to not pose that risk to my dogs, being narrow and chewy and not overly hard with ridges, kind of like a star shaped stick. I only give one a day per dog in the morning because I don't want to upset tummies and I want to keep these a special treat even though these treats have a job. I broke one into fourths and gave them to a friend with a Shi Tzu and suggested one piece per day for him since he is tiny. He loved them. So a little goes a long way. Between the Naked Chew in the morning and the Virbac Enzymatic toothpaste in the evening my dogs teeth are really improving and they are all seniors who had some residue I was looking to improve upon. Teeth are looking shiny white like me after a trip to my favorite dental hygienist. I recommend the combination. The raw diet does contribute of course. These are a safer, healthier dental chew than anything else I've seen with ingredients I am comfortable with offering my dogs in reasonable portions. I recommend supervising your dog at first and considering the size of your dog and the size of the treat and perhaps breaking the treat into smaller portions if you have a smaller dog and offering that either two a day or depending on the sensitivity of your dog's digestion. I order in quantity to reduce cost. I think this is a great product.\n"

Both are strong chewers, so the sticks are gone in less than a minute. They have a pleasant, spicy scent like nutmeg or cinnamon.

He's very picky so I was a little nervous to try them, but I decided to anyway. He LOVES them! He gets so excited and runs around like it's a new bone to chew on. He is about 55 pounds and does go through one rather quickly. But he hasn't had an issue at all with them affecting his stomach (which is AMAZING!) I was skeptical at first since a lot of dog products now say things about helping with digestion. I'm not sure if these actually help with digestion, but seeine as they don't make my pup with a sensitive stomach throw up, they're an A+ in my book! I do wish they made these in bigger sizes. It would last longer for my pup. They do smell a bit odd (they have a slight minty scent) and I was worried about my picky dog not liking that, but he's not affected by it at all.\n",

They also have seemed to help keep his #2 movements nice and even as he had been having some gastric issues and inconsistencies.

We've tried MANY cat treats over our 16 years together (well, I've bought them and he tried them), and he's never loved any like he loves these! He is a longhaired cat and, as a bonus, they have really reduced the amount of hairballs he gets quite substantially, so it's a win/win. Now he will actually meow and \"ask\" for a treat whenever a family member goes to where we keep them, and my daughter has even taught him the \"trick\" of standing on his hind legs and reaching up to \"tap the bag\" with his paw as she holds it in order to \"earn\" a treat. lol\n",

Lately they are more moist then they have ever been.i was scared to feed them to her because they looked darker in color & very vey moist!!! I reached out to Amazon, they just gave me a credit gift card. So I tried again thinking maybe I just got a bad bag. Nope same thing. I didn't reach out to Amazon. Waited a week or two. My cat loves these and I was upset! So I figured I'll try one more time to buy these treats. We'll same thing! And my cat is not crazy about these so I know something isn't right!!! I called Amazon told them the issue, they can see from my account how many times I've purchased these treats! It was ALOT!! I told him something needs to be done about this. He gave me my money back on my card and said he was going to bring it up to the  company that makes these..I don't know if it going to change anything but I can say they lost me as a costumer buying these!!!

No more constipation and little rabbit pellets in the litter box. These cats are pooping like heavy-weight champs! And racing around like crazy cats instead of acting their age. Thank you!Suggestion:  Please make a multi-pack of several of these packets in a box, maybe 12, 16, or 20. It will keep them secure with less crumbling and make them easier to buy and store. We go through around 4 packs a month for 2 cats.\n",

For the 7 kitten we tried antibiotics that didn't help. We tried probiotics that helped somewhat for both cats. We have tried many different foods. After using these treats for a few weeks the kitten has solid poops almost all the time. The 2 year old has large solid poops instead of the small pellets. I recommend putting these on a plate with a few treats your cat really likes to sort of trick them into eating them at first. Once they get used to them they should eat them no problem.\n",

After our old male cat would mouth the \"nums\" when he wanted them. There has never been a treat they didn't like.  Until I bought these. My 5 year female ate a few the first time I gave them to her. The other 2, one being a 6th month old kitten who eats almost everything would not even lick the treats. My female kitty got sick about a hour later. Not sure if it was related but she wouldn't even come near them. I mixed their favorite grocery treats and these to see if they would eat them that way as I said above they left them on the floor.I will go back to the brand I know works and they all like.I hope this review helps.All cats are different.\n",

She likes them enough that when I was a little slow on the uptake recognizing that she wanted treats, I got up the next morning to find the pouch of treats on the floor under my desk with a gaping hole ripped in the side.  That's how much she likes them.Now, whether they help her with hairballs?  That I can't say.  She really never had much of a hairball problem to start with.  We actually bought these for her much-longer-furred younger sister Zenda, who is a serious hairball depositor, but Zenda is kind of \"meh\" about the Get Naked furball treats and much prefers the Feline Greenies.  But that's just fine by Amarillo, who is fine with not having to share.  In fact, she can't get enough of them.  That's why they get stored in a bail-top glass jar now.Amarillo hasn't figured out how to open the jar.Yet.\n",

She ate 2 of them when I first received them, and then turned her nose up at them every other single time I tried to give them to her. They are not as soft as I thought they would be either. They are somewhat soft, but not to my cats liking I guess. They state that they are soft and healthy, which was my reason for purchasing. Unless I happened to get hold of a bad batch or something. Your kitty or cat may like them, but mine doesn’t. All cats are different.\n",

      "Comment: Yo, fellow dog lovers! Just tossed my furry buddy one of these Dental Sticks, grain-free and chicken-flavored, from a 6.6-oz bag made for seniors, and let me tell you – it was an instant hit. This isn't just a treat; it's like a party for their taste buds and a high-five to their dental health.Firstly, the chicken flavor is legit. It's like these sticks have been seasoned with some kind of dog-approved magic. My old boy went for it like it was the best thing since belly rubs.The grain-free part is cool, especially if your pup's got a sensitive stomach. It's like they're keeping it healthy while still making it taste like a cheat day treat.Now, the dental aspect? Spot on. They're tough enough to give those chompers a good workout, helping to keep the tartar and plaque in check. It's like a gym session for their teeth, but way more fun.The size of the sticks is perfect for larger senior dogs. They’re substantial enough to keep them occupied but not too huge. It's like the perfect portion for a good munch without going overboard.And the bag? It's a decent size, meaning you're not running out after just a few treat sessions. It’s like having a ready stash of doggo happiness in your cupboard.\n",

      "Comment: I have bought the other varieties of Get Naked dental treats many times but this is the first time I have seen the senior large versions. The company uses very good ingredients including Dried potatoes, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, potato starch, chicken, natural chicken flavor, flaxseed, green lipped mussel, turmeric, cranberry fiber, calcium carbonate, parsley, l-ascorbyl-2 polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), chia seed, citric acid (preservative), fish oil (source of DHA). The large versions are about twice the size of the small version and suitable for my biggest dog or I could break them in half for my smaller guys.All of my dogs love these. They get either one or 1/2 a day depending on their size. They line up for one for their midmorning snack and can't wait to get them. Even my picky eater loves them. They are made in the US and I feel safe giving them to my dogs.\n",

He likes to take his \"treats\" to his crate and chew on them there but he took one stick to his crate and gnawed on it for awhile, then lost interest and left it in his crate. I did notice he went back to it after awhile but normally he'll be in the crate until it is all gone. I suppose in one way that is good because it lasts awhile but on the opposite side of that, I do not want treats left in his crate. Overall, it just seems too hard for most dogs to chew on it.\n",

I tried breaking it in two. My husband tried breaking it. We then tried cutting it. We could not cut it in half! So, I decided to let them each have one for a taste test. After a few minutes of gnawing, my old dog gave up and walked away. A few minutes later, my other dog yelped and dropped the stick. I think the hard ridge at the edge hit his gums causing pain so I took his away also. I’m giving two stars for ingredients and flavor but they were basically inedible by my dogs. I’d also be very careful of choking if your dog manages to bite off a small piece. A little softer and this could be a good product.\n",

Additionally, they are designed to support senior dogs' dental health, which is crucial as they age.The 6.6-ounce bag provides a good amount of treats to last for a while, and it's a convenient way to incorporate dental care into my dog's daily routine.

I can’t actually give one of them a treat without giving both of them the same thing.  It seriously hurts their feelings if I try.So, the 12-year-old thoroughly enjoys these puppy treats also. :)This is a great price when you buy them in a three pack.

She wasn't doing as well with the rawhide twist sticks, she wasn't chewing them up enough before she tried to swallow the pieces, so I switched to these sticks. She chews these more thoroughly before swallowing, so she hasn't had any issues where I'm worried she's gonna choke.\n"

      "Comment: As of writing this, I have a 8-week-old chihuahua puppy that's about 1-2 pounds. She is very hyperactive and bitey probably due to her teething, which has curbed her desire to bite everything within sight. If you have a bitey puppy, keep one of these on hand to have them chew on. In my opinion, they are a bit small, quite soft, and bendable. Because of that I always make sure to supervise my puppy while she's chewing on it just in case. It seems to last her a good amount, 1 per day for a 2-pound puppy. The recommendation on the back feels spot on so follow it.\n",

I first found these at a pet store while volunteering at an adoption event for a local rescue. I was looking for a soft treat I could give the dogs I was handling. I decided to give these a try and all the dogs around me (both big and small) loved them so much they barely gave me a chance to take them out of the package. After that I decided to buy them for my dog (he's a Lahsa Apso), and he really loved them and this brand in general. I buy him these, the ones for a healthy coat, and the digestive health sticks.\n",

These were a godsend I tried on a whim, and now they will forever remain a part of our daily treat time. The treats are small and soft- perfect for a senior- and he truly enjoys the taste. They are easy on his stomach, and I have seen a marked improvement in his bowel movements. Wonderful product!\n",

After a short time, I noticed she's getting a bounce back in her step and acting like a puppy again.  It smells good  even to this human nose, fresh and I love the little heart shape.  It's soft enough for my dog who rarely will even eat a hard dog biscuit.  The only drawback is she gets 1 a day and some days I forget to give it to her.

To lessen the risk of her choking even more, I give the treats a little squeeze to start the crumble process. I'm so glad I found this treat as a delicious option for her.\n",

      "Comment: We got these because our 15 year old chihuahua is very healthy for her age, but not able to eat anything hard because of some dental issues.We figured if she can get these down, they help her nutritionally, and make her happy, that would be a huge win.Regarding how she took to them...At first, she didn't eat these treats at all, but she is very fussy about food in general.Leaving a few near her favorite sleeping spot, she eventually decided she could deign to eat them as a snack.If you have a dog who is very into treats, I suspect they will gobble these up without hesitation.The treats themselves are: covered with some sort of yellow powder; they are quite small; their texture is soft, but not squishy, and though they have a scent, it is neither intense, nor unpleasant.As shown on the product page, the recommended serving is 8 to 10 treats for dogs 5 lbs and up.Whet they arrived, the treats had a best by date just over six months away, so they're not a treat you can keep on a back shelf forever.One thing I did not like is that they do not specify where these are produced.The company that sells them is based in Texas, but they do not state whether they are manufactured there, which leaves me wondering where they actually come from.Our picky lady does not eat these until she feels like it, but can manage them, even with some dental issues, so I think they are a good choice for senior dogs.She also has experienced no negative side effects from taking them, so that is obviously a big plus in and of itself.I would say if you are looking for a treat for an older dog that is small and easy for them to get down, this would be a good one to try.\n",

      "Comment: My three dogs have been big fans of the old formula of these treats for quite a few years now. They are special favorites of my oldest dog (12) and pickiest eater. Because he is still extremely active, I try to give him as much glucosamine and chondroitin as I can. So the Get Naked Joint Health treats were a wonderful discovery. My dogs also enjoyed the other flavors in the line.When the formula was discontinued with the launch of the new grain free version, I was incredibly disappointed. Especially because the new treats had not reached the super-affordable price I was used to with the old formula (< $4) and the price on the discontinued formula was skyrocketing, which is typical of a market for a discontinued product. I was afraid that my dogs wouldn't like the new formula or that it would make them sick. I still don't understand why they needed to go grain free, considering that the grains in the old formula consisted only of rice and oats (which I didn't think were a big concern in doggie diets), but I am very glad the treats came back down to the extremely affordable price that my dogs and I love. Happily, the treats pass the doggie taste test and have yet to come back up the way they came.So without further ado, here is my comparison to the old formula for the treats:OUTSIDE: To start of, the packaging of the treats is very similar in wording and warnings, although the ingredient list does differ a bit. The package is orange instead of chartreuse, and since I don't particularly like either color it doesn't matter much that the bag got uglier. However, the development of the new packaging was clearly misguided. Perhaps in an attempt to make the packaging look like more \"natural\" products do in most marketing, the appearance of the bag has been ~softened~ to the point where things are very hard to read. Ditching the outline on the letters on the front was a big mistake with the gradient to light orange in the center, since it makes the letters look so fuzzy I thought my glasses were dirty or falling off my face. On the back, the crisp black lettering for the nutritional information was traded in for an even smaller font in white letters again. I can see that the smaller font was likely necessary because the packaging is now bilingual in English and French, but the choice of white is once again irritating to the eye. Even the NPIC logo and company information is so blurry that it is completely illegible.INSIDE: The grain ingredients, as well as tapioca starch, in the old formula have been replaced with potatoes. The rest of the ingredients listed are the same. The nutritional analysis is almost identical, with the exception that the Crude Protein minimum is 20% instead of 18%. The glucosamine per serving (32mg) and chondroitin sulfate (19mg) are the same, and now DHA is listed as well (4mg). The calorie content per treat remains at 26 kcal.The treats themselves are the same length and shape as the old formula, and have an almost identical amount of give as far as the hardness of the treat goes (which is good because the 10 year old rescue dog only has 5 teeth). They are not scary hard, but chewy enough to keep the dogs entertained for a few minutes and delicious enough to get the dogs excited when they see their favorite treat bag (which they know by shape and sound). Watching my dog chomp away, I would say that these new treats may be a bit tougher to bit through, although not too much.I was a little disappointed when I compared the new and old treats and found that the new ones are a bit slimmer than they used to be. It's not much, but considering that there were 2 less in the bag than you got in the old formula that was a bit sad. However, I noticed that the new treats are slightly heavier per piece, and the higher density makes sense with the extra chewing my toothless wonderdog was doing. The smell of the new formula is comparable to the old, slightly different but similar and nothing my dogs minded too much.If the treats continue to stay at this low price, I'll be very happy and hopefully my concerns over the formula switch will have been for nothing. I don't think I would pay more than $5 or so per bag, but that's partly because I can't afford much more right now as a pet indulgence and partly because I'm also just cheap (as much as I can be while still taking great care of my dogs). Also, I prefer to give the two older dogs at least one of these per day, since it makes them happy and gives them some extra vitamins that their little arthritic knees crave. At this price, I can do that.[...] I rely on reviews for my online purchases and want to do my part by making my reviews as helpful as I can. Thanks for reading!\n"

I love that they are low in calorie and do not contain rawhide which could cause a potential issue with my dog.  I am very cautious on the chews he is permitted to have since his health is my primary concern.  I actually have my little guy on a diet so I have been snapping these in half every night which he gets after his teeth brushing.  Every night he waits in the bathroom for me to wash my face and he patiently waits his turn to get his teeth brushed.  Yes that is correct I brush his teeth every single night before we go to bed and his reward is half of one of these chew sticks.  I never before have seen this brand in the local pet stores, I love the variety I am able to find on Amazons site I wanted these in particular since my pup has 2 grade 3 patellas anything that is good for his joints I will buy for him to help him stay healthy.

My 10 week old lab chewed through and ate this stick within 3 minutes of giving it to him. So if you do get these teething sticks for your pups, just be sure to watch them closely. It says 3 sticks daily for 16 to 25lb puppies, but I would not recommend that, as they are super thin and could potentially be a choking hazard. They do not have a strong smell as well.\n",

At first, both cats would devour them just like the other kind. However, after a few days, the pickier of the two would begin to vomit after eating a few of the health treats, and even the other one would no longer inhale them like he used to.2 days later, the fussy eater will not touch the health treats at all, and will also no longer touch the furball treats - shame, thought I'd finally found something she'd like, but I guess it was not meant to be.

And I’ve learned they want the exact same treat.I am not strong enough to break this ring in pieces. So I give one to my older dog. She breaks it up. The little dog grabs a piece and runs.Of course all the other pieces get eaten by my 12 year old dog.Since I don’t have the flexibility to give them smaller pieces, it gives the older dog much more of this treat at one time than I would prefer.Both of my dogs devour this in record time.  No slow chewing. No lasting for days. It’s gone before I get the dishes put in the dishwasher.It may work perfectly fine in a single dog household. Or maybe if you had an older dog who did not want every single thing the puppy gets… and vice versa.But, for me and my family, it isn’t quite working out the way I hoped.It is a good product.

They’re a great size for her current size of 4-5 pounds.Do not leave your puppy unattended with these.  I would say that my puppy is an aggressive chewer.

He has a problem with eating things he's not supposed to and I was looking for something to help relieve his chewing on bad things. I always hated how they didn't have any good chew things for cats because I can attest that chew cats exist! Well my cat didn't want anything to do with these chews... The packaging makes it look like it's a meaty chew, but its actually a firm clear-ish gelatinous stick, I'm assuming its a juice or or artificial flavoring? I won't be buying these again, but I'm glad this is on the market because I'm sure some cats would love it, just not mine. It's well packaged and is resealable. I'd like to suggest an alternative that I found that my cat actually likes. It's Dogswell Happy Hips Salmon or Chicken Jerky. They're made for dogs but they're just dehydrated meat with no hormones or additives so it's good for cats too, and your cat may like it if it doesn't like these because it's actually meat!\n",

I always break them in half because of the serving sizes recommendations. These ones felt super critter and just broke into small pieces when doing This. I gave a larger piece to my pup under supervision and she immediate broke it into small pieces like I did. These small pieces are a choking hazard so didn’t give them to her. I’d say stick to the normal rings and stay away from Plus\n",

I had to break the treats into half because they were just unusually big for my 8-lb Ragdoll. Unfortunately, she hates chicken flavor, so I could only give her 2 treats a day for 2 days max. The second day she threw up because she just didn't like it and I couldn't manage to give it to her the third day. I wish there was a fish or beef flavor of this digestive health treats since those are her favorite flavors. The scent was really strong too, so if your cat hates chicken flavor as well, they're definitely not going to eat this. I suggest giving like 2 treats in their food bowl and burying the scent with wet cat food.\n",
